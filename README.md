# Advanced-control-of-a-DC-motor-
This project implements an embedded DC motor control system using an STM32 microcontroller. A finite state machine manages STOP, FORWARD, and REVERSE modes. Motor speed is controlled via PWM adjusted by an ADC-read potentiometer, while a TB6612FNG driver handles direction and power. Status LEDs and an I²C LCD provide real-time feedback.
